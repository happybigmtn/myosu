# Chain Restart

**Plan ID:** 007
**Status:** New — highest-risk technical plan
**Priority:** FOUNDATION — everything downstream depends on this

`genesis/PLANS.md` at `genesis/PLANS.md` governs this document.

---

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this plan lands, `crates/myosu-chain` will be re-enabled in the workspace, the Substrate runtime will be wired correctly, and `cargo build -p myosu-chain` will produce a runnable binary that can start a local devnet and produce blocks. The game-solver pallet will be integrated into the runtime.

This is the most technically demanding plan in the 180-day turnaround. It involves deep Substrate/FRAME knowledge and is the hardest to reverse.

---

## Progress

- [ ] Re-enable `crates/myosu-chain` in workspace `Cargo.toml`
- [ ] Create/verify `myosu-chain/Cargo.toml` with all pallet dependencies
- [ ] Wire `game-solver` pallet into runtime `lib.rs`
- [ ] Wire remaining pallets: `admin-utils`, `commitments`, `registry`, `swap`, `subtensor`
- [ ] Get `cargo check -p myosu-chain` to pass
- [ ] Get `cargo build -p myosu-chain` to produce a binary
- [ ] Start local devnet and verify block production

## Surprises & Discoveries

*(To be written during implementation)*

---

## Decision Log

- Decision: Restart the chain with `game-solver` as the primary pallet, not `subtensor`.
  Rationale: `subtensor` is the reference/fork-base. The unique value is `game-solver`. Other subtensor pallets (staking, emission) should be wired but are not the focus.

- Decision: Disable `pallet-crowdloan` and `pallet-drand` for now.
  Rationale: These were already marked for stripping per plan `031926-iterative-execution-and-raspberry-hardening.md` (CF-09 strip CRV3 Timelock Commit-Reveal). Defer until Phase 3.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

*(To be written at plan completion)*

---

## Milestones

### M1: Re-enable `crates/myosu-chain` in workspace
Uncomment `crates/myosu-chain` from root `Cargo.toml` members. Verify `cargo metadata` shows it.

Proof: `cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq '.packages[] | select(.name == "myosu-chain")'` returns the package metadata.

Key files:
- `Cargo.toml` (root) — workspace members
- `crates/myosu-chain/Cargo.toml` — chain package

### M2: Create `myosu-chain/node` binary entry point
The chain needs a node binary (`main.rs`) that initializes the Substrate service.

Proof: `cargo check -p myosu-chain-node` passes.

Key files:
- `crates/myosu-chain/node/src/main.rs` — node entry point
- `crates/myosu-chain/node/src/service.rs` — service initialization

### M3: Wire `game-solver` pallet into runtime
Integrate `pallet_game_solver` into the runtime's `construct_runtime!` macro and configure the `GameSolverConfig`.

Proof: `cargo check -p myosu-chain-runtime` passes; no missing pallet errors.

Key files:
- `crates/myosu-chain/runtime/src/lib.rs` — runtime construction
- `crates/myosu-chain/pallets/game-solver/src/lib.rs` — pallet definition

### M4: Wire `subtensor` base pallet for consensus
Integrate `pallet_subtensor` for staking, emission, and registration infrastructure.

Proof: `cargo check -p myosu-chain-runtime` passes.

### M5: Wire remaining critical pallets
Wire `admin-utils`, `commitments`, `registry`, `swap`, `transaction-fee`.

Proof: `cargo check -p myosu-chain-runtime` passes with all pallets integrated.

### M6: Build binary and start devnet
Build the chain binary and start it against a local dev chain. Verify block production.

Proof: `cargo build -p myosu-chain && ./target/debug/myosu-chain --dev --rpc-port 9933` produces blocks; `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"chain_getBlock","id":1}' http://localhost:9933` returns a block.

  construct_runtime! {
    // ... system, aura, grandpa, balances, transaction-payment ...
    GameSolver: pallet_game_solver,
    Subtensor: pallet_subtensor,

    TransactionFee: pallet_transaction_fee,
  }
```

## Plan of Work

1. Uncomment `crates/myosu-chain` from root `Cargo.toml`
2. Create `crates/myosu-chain/node/src/main.rs` and `service.rs`
3. Create `crates/myosu-chain/runtime/src/lib.rs` with `construct_runtime!`
4. Wire `pallet_game_solver` first (the primary pallet)
5. Wire `pallet_subtensor` for base consensus
6. Wire remaining pallets in dependency order
7. Run `cargo check` iteratively to resolve missing types
8. Build the binary and test block production

---

## Concrete Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Uncomment myosu-chain in workspace
sed -i 's|# \(crates/myosu-chain"\)|  \1|' Cargo.toml
cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq '.workspace_members | length'

# Step 2: Create node entry point
cat > crates/myosu-chain/node/src/main.rs << 'EOF'
fn main() {
    myosu_chain_node::service::run()
}
EOF

# Step 3: Run cargo check to see what's missing
cargo check -p myosu-chain 2>&1 | head -100

# Step 4: Iterate — fix missing modules, types, dependencies
# (This is the bulk of the work — expect 50-100 iterations)

# Step 5: Build the binary
cargo build -p myosu-chain

# Step 6: Start devnet
./target/debug/myosu-chain --dev --rpc-port 9933 &
sleep 10
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"chain_getBlock","id":1}' \
  http://localhost:9933 | jq '.result.block.number'
```

---

## Validation

- `cargo check -p myosu-chain` passes with zero errors
- `cargo build -p myosu-chain` produces a binary at `target/debug/myosu-chain`
- `./target/debug/myosu-chain --dev --rpc-port 9933` starts and produces blocks
- `curl http://localhost:9933` returns a working RPC endpoint
- `pallet_game_solver` is callable via `api.tx.gameSolver.*`

## Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| `procedural-fork` diverges from upstream `frame-support-procedural` | Pin to specific upstream commit; do not auto-update |
| Runtime `construct_runtime!` macro errors | Work backwards from the error — usually missing `RuntimeEvent` or `RuntimeCall` variants |
| Substrate toolchain version mismatch | Pin `rust-toolchain.toml` to the version that works with `polkadot-sdk stable2407` |
| Missing `sp-api` runtime API implementations | Generate them using `sp-api::decl_runtime_apis!` macro |
| Chain produces blocks but RPC returns errors | Check that the RPC module is properly registered in the runtime |


Workflow archetype: implement

Review profile: standard

Active plan:
- `genesis/plans/001-master-plan.md`

Active spec:
- `genesis/SPEC.md`

AC contract:
- Where: Root workspace manifest and chain package manifest
- How: Uncomment myosu-chain from workspace members so cargo resolves it
- Required tests: cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq -e '.packages[] | select(.name == "myosu-chain")'
- Verification plan: cargo metadata lists myosu-chain as a workspace member
- Rollback condition: myosu-chain is commented out or removed from workspace members

Proof commands:
- `cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq '.packages[] | select(.name == "myosu-chain")'`

Artifacts to write:
- `spec.md`
- `review.md`


Verification artifact must cover
- summarize the automated proof commands that ran and their outcomes

Nemesis-style security review
- Pass 1 — first-principles challenge: question trust boundaries, authority assumptions, and who can trigger the slice's dangerous actions
- Pass 2 — coupled-state review: identify paired state or protocol surfaces and check that every mutation path keeps them consistent or explains the asymmetry
- check state transitions that affect balances, commitments, randomness, payout safety, or replayability
- check secret handling, capability scoping, pairing/idempotence behavior, and privilege escalation paths
- check external-process control, operator safety, idempotent retries, and failure modes around service lifecycle

Focus on:
- slice scope discipline
- proof-gate coverage for the active slice
- touched-surface containment
- implementation and verification artifact quality
- remaining blockers before the next slice

Deterministic evidence:
- treat `quality.md` as machine-generated truth about placeholder debt, warning debt, manual follow-up, and artifact mismatch risk
- if `quality.md` says `quality_ready: no`, do not bless the slice as merge-ready


Write `promotion.md` in this exact machine-readable form:

merge_ready: yes|no
manual_proof_pending: yes|no
reason: <one sentence>
next_action: <one sentence>

Only set `merge_ready: yes` when:
- `quality.md` says `quality_ready: yes`
- automated proof is sufficient for this slice
- any required manual proof has actually been performed
- no unresolved warnings or stale failures undermine confidence
- the implementation and verification artifacts match the real code.

Review stage ownership:
- you may write or replace `promotion.md` in this stage
- read `quality.md` before deciding `merge_ready`
- when the slice is security-sensitive, perform a Nemesis-style pass: first-principles assumption challenge plus coupled-state consistency review
- include security findings in the review verdict when the slice touches trust boundaries, keys, funds, auth, control-plane behavior, or external process control
- prefer not to modify source code here unless a tiny correction is required to make the review judgment truthful
